CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.0
----------------------

  o fix in 'reads2pairs': when the two reads of a read pair map to different chromosomes, they will be returned within the
  'singleReads' element of the output (before function gave en error in case of such read pairs)
  o added optional argument 'max.distance' to 'reads2pairs'; when the reads of a read pair are further apart than 'max.dist'
  bases, they will be added to the 'singleReads' element of the output instead to the 'readpairs' element



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
----------------------

  o added elements 'targetCoverageSD' and 'targetCoverageQuantiles' to output of function coverage.target
  o added column 'coverageSD' to 'targetCoverages' output of function coverage.target
  o 'chrom.barplot' can now show fractions of reads and targets per chromosome simultaneously 
  o 'coverage.plot' can now be called repeatedly to show coverage of several samples in one graph
