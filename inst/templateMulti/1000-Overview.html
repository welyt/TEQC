<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  This document shows summaries of Target Enrichment Quality Control (TEQC) results 
for several samples and hence facilitates 
	quality inspection across samples within a project. 
    Quality measures comprise specificity and sensitivity of the capture, global on-target coverage, coverage uniformity, 
	and correlation of per-target coverage between samples.
