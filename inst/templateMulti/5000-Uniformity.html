<h2>Coverage Uniformity</h2>

<p>
  The following plot shows for each sample the cumulative 
fraction of target bases (y-axis) with a coverage of at least the corresponding x-axis value. 
The lines represent a "continuous version" of the barplots in the previous section, with all possible values of coverage 
instead of only a few selected ones.
For the figure on the right normalized coverage values are used, i.e. the per-base coverage values
divided by the average coverage over all target bases. The normalized coverage
is not dependent on the absolute quantity of sequenced reads and is hence
better comparable between different samples. The x-axis in this graph is truncated at 1, which corresponds to the average normalized coverage. 
The steeper the curve is falling, the less uniform is the coverage.
